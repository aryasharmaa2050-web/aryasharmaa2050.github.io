I'm passionate about transforming raw data into strategic insights that drive smarter business decisions.

## About Me

I specialize in using **Python** and **SQL** to perform in-depth data analysis and deliver actionable insights. With hands-on experience in **data visualization tools** like **Power BI** and **Tableau**, I enjoy turning complex data into clear, compelling dashboards and visual stories.

I hold the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP)** certification, which has enhanced my understanding of cloud fundamentals and how they enable scalable, data-driven solutions. Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in areas like **data warehousing** and **big data technologies** (e.g., **Hadoop**, **Spark**, **Kafka**) through my CDS coursework.

Thanks for visiting my portfolio â€” I'm excited to share my projects and showcase my growth as a data-driven business professional.
